<h1>Bachelor Thesis Overview</h1>

<h2>Prog Gen</h2>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Exploring different ways to increase immersion in procedurally generated 2D game worlds</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build a small game and implement different proc gen algorithms and analyse impact on player immersion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gameplay very simple, something like resource gathering and crafting</li>
  <li>The more structure a system has the harder it is to procedurally generate it</li>
  <li>Nature fairly easy to generate, human structures harder</li>
</ul>

<p>In nature here are basically no interdependencies. See how a single path (non natural) is already much harder to generate procedurally.</p>

<p>Streets of Rogue, proc gen of an entire world, see <a href="https://youtu.be/nGahQVeBoTY?t=128">https://youtu.be/nGahQVeBoTY?t=128</a>. Much more challenging.</p>

<h2>NPCs</h2>

<p><strong>Title: </strong>Comparing the impact on immersion between minimalistic and sophisticated NPCs</p>

<p><strong>Goal: </strong>Create a simple sandbox game with the focus on minimalistic yet immersive NPCs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lower the player expectations towards NPC behaviour, the easier it is to keep player immersed</li>
  <li>Very much influenced by art direction and level of realism</li>
  <li>NPCs can seem much more intelligent than they actually are with simple tricks</li>
  <li>Explore ways to utilize these tricks and avoid immersion breaking pitfalls</li>
</ul>

<p>Rain World has as its primary focus NPCs/enemy interaction. The individual AI is not all that complex, but it appears smart because it doesn't behave in unexpected ways (most of the enemies are animals).</p>

<p>Skyrim has a lot of interaction, however that means that it's extremely hard to account for every last edge case. You can freely rob any NPC by placing a bucket on their had because <em>they can't see you.</em></p>

<h2>Idler Game</h2>

<p><strong>Title: </strong>Increasing UX and perceived meaningfulness in Idler games by combining it with the Building genre</p>

<p><strong>Goal: </strong>Create a small game about planting crops and trees and building your own garden/natural habitat.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most idler games are literally just number go up</li>
  <li>While there is a market for that (seemingly), I believe these games can be greatly improved in regard to how meaningful they feel</li>
  <li>Combine the gratification of progress with the creative outlet of building</li>
  <li>Plants interact with eachother and reward/punish if other plants of a certain type are placed closely</li>
</ul>

<p>Game would be 2D top down pixel art game (below is the game Terrafactor as an idea).</p>

<p>ISLANDERS uses score points as reward/punishment for building. Some buildings have positive effects towards others negative effects.</p>
