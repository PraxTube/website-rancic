<h1>Idle Game</h1>

<a href="/bachelor-tmp2/">Back</a>

<p><strong>H1: </strong>Incorporating building mechanics in idle games leads to increased player engagement.</p>
<p style="color: gray;"><strong>H2: </strong>The presence of a fantasy increases player immersion and engagement compared to abstract or non-themed settings.</p>

<p style="color: gray;"><strong>RQ1: </strong>How does the type of fantasy influence player engagement?</p>
<p><strong>RQ2: </strong>How do building mechanics in idle games impact player immersion?</p>
<p><strong>RQ3: </strong>How do building mechanics in idle games influence players' long-term sense of meaningfulness?</p>

<h3>How Can We Test in a Single Session?</h3>

Skip growing process (instant gratification).

<ul>
  <li>Only increases baseline (absolute) engagement</li>
  <li>Doesn't affect relative engagement</li>
  <li>Increases playtime for single session</li>
  <li>Less idle game and more clicker/incremental game, but all of them are heavily intertwined anyways</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameloop</h3>

<p>I think the underlying hypothesis can be answered even with a short and single session of play. <a href="https://farmclicker.github.io/#/" target="_blank">See this example.</a></p>

<h3>Quantitative Measurements (Game Telemetry)</h3>

<h4>In Person (Single Session)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Playtime Till Bored (how would this work in the lab?)</li>
  <li>Downtime/idle time during active play</li>
  <li>Clicks/actions per minute</li>
  <li>Time of unlocking new content (progression)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Over Multiple Days</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Return rate (retention)</li>
  <li>Session lengths</li>
  <li>Total playtime</li>
</ul>
