  <h1>Procedural 2D World Generation</h1>
  <time id="blog-date" datetime="2024-06-14">DATE</time>

  <p>
  Creating a procedurally generate 2D world for my <a href="https://github.com/PraxTube/lost-oppai">next game</a>.
  How I went from nothing to this,
  showing my experience with procedural world generation in incremental steps.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>
  My motivation for using procedural generation in Lost Oppai was quite simple:
  I dislike level/map design. So instead I designed an algorithm that designs maps for me :)
  </p>

  <h2>From Nothing To Something</h2>

  <p>
  The very first thing I did was to create islands (water and grass tiles only).
  I used a simple perlin noise map to determine whether to place a water tile or a grass tile,
  nothing fancy.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/01.png">

  <p>
  Then I got rid of those ugly placeholder tiles and used an actual tileset.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/02.png">

  <p>
  Much better, but the transition from water to grass just looks horrible.
  Next I implemented bitmasks to determine which tile to place
  based on the neighbhoring tile types. This isn't exactly hard,
  but if it's your first time dealing with bitmasks
  then it can a bit tricky.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/03.png">

  <p>
  After that I added a bit of variaty to the grass tiles by
  just randomly selecting any valid grass tiles from the tileset.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/04.png">

  <h2>Player And Collisions</h2>

  <p>
  Okay, with a map somewhat resembling an actual game now
  I finally added the player character,
  this is a game afterall...
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/05.png">

  <p>
  Now that a playable character is in place I had to add collision boxes.
  This was already a bit of a pain and showed me that the system I had in
  place was kinda ass. Determining where to place collision boxes
  is pretty easy, you just check that for each tile the 3x3 bitmask
  contains both grass and water (if that is the case, then we have an edge).
  </p>

  <p>
  The real problem was debugging this.
  I didn't create any debugging tools (even to this day).
  Don't ask why.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/06.png">

  <p>
  I gotta say I really like how the islands look now,
  I used two noise maps and cheaply overlay them
  to create a slightly more interesting pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think the islands should be a bit bigger
  as it's pretty unrealistic for islands to pop up the
  way they do here, at least not for this size.
  The problem with bigger islandes is that the player would rarely
  see water and it would look a lot more monotonous when playing.
  This is most likely a limitation of my game size.
  In a big open world game this would be less of an issue I think.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/07.png">

  <h2>Path Generation</h2>

  <p>
  Now we are getting into the more spicy generation part.
  One thing I absolutely wanted to implement in the game was paths.
  This doesn't sound too terribly complicated at first,
  I mean we can already
  generate an entire ocean afterall,
  but implementing paths was a huge challenge.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/08.png">

  <p>
  I implemented a basic system that takes two points
  and creates a path with a bit of a curvature using Bezier curves.
  One big problem I faced was that I couldn't exactly
  figure out how to generate the paths so that they are always
  on top of grass and not just go over the ocean.
  The issue is that I didn't have any guarantee that two points are even
  on the same island and thus connectable.
  To fix this I just opted to overwrite any water tile to grass tile near the paths.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/09.png">

  <p>
  I also figured I would give the path a dynamic width so that it isn't completely uniform.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/10.png">

  <p>
  Implementing the paths was already a big challenge,
  but only now did I realize the huge downsize of a 3x3 bitmask.
  3x3 bitmasks are pretty easy to implement and intuitive.
  However it also means that you need <code>2^8 = 256</code>
  different tiles to map every single possible tile combination.
  256! The tileset I used had 16 tiles...
  </p>

  <p>
  I remembered hearing something about 2x2 bitmasks and
  searched a bit on how to implement those until I found
  <a href="https://youtu.be/Uxeo9c-PX-w?t=548">this talk</a>.
  Dualgrid is the solution.
  Instead of each tile having 8 neighbhors,
  we instead create a second grid and shift it by half a grid cell
  and as a result only end up with 4 neighbhors.
  What does that mean for the number of tiles we need?
  Well, it's <code>2^4 = 16</code> tiles now, nice!
  </p>

  <p>
  This does of course also have drawbacks
  (as there are no solutions, only trades offs).
  Firstly, this makes the backend slightly more complex.
  This is practically not noticable.
  But secondly, and more importantly, we aren't able to map our bitmap grid
  that tells us if a cell is water or grass directly to the rendered grid.
  Yes, we have the neighbhoring tiles, but it's not obvious at all how we map these two.
  </p>

  <p>
  It took me some trial and error to implement certain things after this change
  and it makes future features a lot harder,
  for example the collisions don't work anymore,
  checking the edges will lead to false positives now.
  This means I have to rewrite the collisions
  entirely, however it also means I have an opportunity to improve on them.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/11.png">

  <p>
  The 2x2 bitmask dual grid system is nonetheless extremely worth it.
  Implementing paths is a bit tricky because of it, but it means that we can
  generate any combination of tiles and don't need to worry about our algorithm
  putting tiles next to each other that aren't covered by the tileset.
  Having a slightly more complex backend is definitely worth it.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/12.png">

  <p>
  Next I placed the path tiles along each generated path with a given width.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/13.png">

  <p>
  I really like how the bezier curves make the connected points look much more interesting.
  It's so simple yet so effective.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/14.png">

  <p>
  Next I experimented with terrain generation a bit.
  I didn't exactly know how to integrate the water to the paths.
  I thought that perhaps some ponds or similar smaller bodies of water
  would work best here, but I would have also liked to have bigger seas.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/15.png">

  <p>
  Another edge case I have to account for:
  The area around the spawning position of the player
  needs to be guaranteed to be grass in order to place
  the keyboard hints (otherwise it would look horrible).
  </p>

  <p>
  It is these little things that make procedural world
  generation in a video game so difficult.
  We aren't just generating some world that should look
  realistic, we usually want to place things into this world too.
  These things have certain constrains that you need to make sure are met.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/16.png">

  <p>
  I wanted to have points around the spawn position of the player
  that are all at least a certain distance away.
  These points would be used as vertices in a graph and then
  connected via edges using Kruskals algorithm
  and then I could visualize the edges as paths.
  </p>

  <p>
  Generating the points was the biggest challenge here.
  I used the Poisson disk sampling approach to generate
  a bunch of points which each were guaranteed to have a
  prespecified distance from one another.
  </p>

  <p>
  Using these points we can place our points of interest
  there (in this case NPCs the player talks to).
  But this could easily have been cities or anything else
  on any kind of scale.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/17.png">

  <h2>Flora And Fauna</h2>

  <p>
  I got sick of looking at this empty map
  so decided it was time to add some flora.
  I used the same poisson disk sampling to make
  sure all the vegetation is at least a certain distance
  apart from one another.
  It's a bit more complicated in this case though,
  as we have variable radii (the trees must be
  further away from other trees then the bushes to other bushes etc.).
  This algorithm doesn't work perfectly, but I am not
  competent enough to make it work better then its current state.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/18.png">

  <p>
  Next I filled the map with grass and figured out how to integrate the bodies of water.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/19.png">

  <p>
  I noticed a nasty visual issue with the Y-Sort.
  The shadows of the trees weren't working correctly.
  Fixing this was a huge pain and my current solution
  is also more of a work-around than an actual
  fix but it works for this game.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/20.png">

  <p>
  I played a bit with the hyper-parameters of the generation process
  and made sure the bushes could not spawn on top of the path.
  Again, another constraint you need to make sure is
  in place in order to properly place things.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/21.png">

  <p>
  I added patches of flowers to make the scene more interesting.
  I really think it adds a lot. The implementation is very similar
  to how the water is generated and was pretty straightforward.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/22.png">

  <p>
  I thought it was kind of lifeless so I added some fauna (birds in this case).
  I actually meant for this to be a little reward for getting this far with the
  world generation and thought this would only take around 2 hours...
  it didn't, it took me 2 weeks :') Worth it though, the birds are awesome.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/23.png">

  <p>
  The tileset I used also had these nice (and most importantly easy to implement)
  water sparkle animations. I generate them similarly to the
  the patches of flowers, it adds a lot to the otherwise boring looking water.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/24.png">

  <p>
  I finished it up by adding a bit of variety to the water sparkling tiles
  and again, little effort big reward. The water sparkles looked too uniform
  before and look more interesting now.
  </p>

  <img src="/blog/world-proc-gen/pics/25.png">

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
  That's all! My first attempt at procedural world generation.
  My implementation is definitely not the prettiest
  and it still has quite a few issues.
  That being said, I am very pleased with the result
  and really like the atmosphere it creates.
  </p>

  <p>
  One thing I would definitely change next time
  is to write propper debugging tools.
  Just a simple visualization of the bitmap grid would have
  been useful in so many situations.
  </p>

  <p>
  I hope this was interesting and helpful.
  I will most likely revisit this blog
  the next time I try my hands on procedural world generation.
  Until then.
