    I made a cozy little 2D top down mage game.
    You walk around the map, activating statues and killing
    enemies by casting spells.
    In this blog post, I describe my development process
    and the challanges I faced using the Bevy game engine.
  </p>

  <h2>The Game</h2>

  <p>
    The game Magus Parvus,
    which you can <a href="https://praxtube.itch.io/magus-parvus">play on itch</a>,
    is a small 2D top down game where you cast spells by typing them out.
    It's fairly short, but that's kind of the point.
    I wanted to make a very small and compact game that would teach me
    the basics of how to create a 2D top down game.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this post I will focus on the technical implementation
    and some challanges that I see that need to be addressed to make
    the development process of this kind of game more feasible.
    To get a broader understanding of the game, check out
    <a href="TODO INSERT YT LINK">my youtube video</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Implementation in Bevy</h2>

  <p>
    The game is made in <code>bevy 0.12.1</code> and uses
    the following third party crates.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>bevy_rapier2d</code> - Physics and Collisions
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>bevy_ecs_ldtk</code> - Map Loading
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>bevy_kira_audio</code> - Music and Sounds
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>bevy_asset_loader</code> - Loading assets
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>bevy_trickfilm</code> - 2D Sprite Animations
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>bevy_screen_diagnostics</code> - Debugging Diagnostics
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>noisy_bevy</code> - Noise Map (for camera shake)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The main challange here was to get dynamic chunkloading to work
  with the <code>bevy_ecs_ldtk</code> package.
  Implementing physics and collisions with <code>bevy_rapier2d</code>
  was also a little tedious, but this is mostly because their documentation
  is somewhat broken (quite a lot of outdated href links).
  Apart from that, most of the development was concerned with implementing
  the actual features of the game.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Process</h2>

  <h3>Map Creation with LDtk</h3>

  There weren't any examples or blogs about it (at least none that I could find),
  but luckily the maintainer of the crate is really friendly.
  I <a href="https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk/issues/268">opened an issue</a>
  and he was quick to guide me on how to implement it.
  Turns out, there actually IS an example on how to do this,
  I of course somehow managed to miss that.

  So following the example on how to load and delete level sections,
  I got a basic chunkloading system in place.
  This is actually a bit overkill for this project, but it's going to be
  very useful for future games.

  <h3>Physics and Collisions</h3>

  <h3>Sprite Animations</h3>

  <h3>UI</h3>
