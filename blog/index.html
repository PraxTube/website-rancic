  <h1>Blogs</h1>

  A collection of my blogs which I am most likely going to reference manually here. I did spend quite some time trying to get javascript and php to work together to fetch the index.html files of the blogs, and while it did work to some degree, it just doesn't seem that worth it right now. It also seems very brittle and it's a bit of a performance bottleneck (though only if I would have like >1000 blogs).
