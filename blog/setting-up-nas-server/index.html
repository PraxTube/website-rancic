  <h1>Setting up a NAS server</h1>
  <time id="blog-date" datetime="2023-11-8">DATE</time>

  <p>
    A NAS (network-attached storage) server is very useful
    for storing and distributing data on a local network.
    In this post, I am going to show you how you can create
    your own ubuntu NAS server.
  </p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

  <p>
    In order to run our own NAS server we obviously first need a server.
    Go ahead and install the an ubuntu server on a free device.
    The <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview">ubuntu install instructions</a>
    are very simple, you should be able to follow them and have a running server in less then an hour. I suggest using the non GUI server, at least that's what I assuming
    you will have in this tutorial. It does work with the desktop
    server as well though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once that is all set up, we are going to install some packages
    we will need to for the NAS server. First, let's go ahead and
    install a better package manager called
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/volian/nala">nala</a>.
  </p>

  <pre>
    sudo apt install nala
  </pre>

  <p>
    Once that is done, we call use <code>nala</code>
    instead of <code>apt</code> to install packages.
    Let's go ahead and use it to install a text editor.
  </p>

  <pre>
    sudo nala install vim
  </pre>

  <p>
    You should see a much cleaner visual for the installing process.
    While it would be totally fine to use <code>apt</code>,
    you benifit from using <code>nala</code> as it not only looks
    a lot better and is more readable, it also has quite a few
    features.
  <p>

  <h2>Setting a Static IP Address</h2>

  <p>
    With all of this setup complete, we can finally begin
    to setup our NAS server. To start we will make our private
    IP address static.
    Every device in your local network has a private IP address
    which your internet router uses to know which data package
    needs to go where. These private IP addresses can change
    when you for example change your router. This is not a problem
    for in most cases, but when using a NAS server we will
    access our server through the private IP address.
    So we are going to need to make the private IP address static.
  </p>

  <p>
    First of all we will need to figure out what IP addresses our
    server has. We do this by simply running the following command.
  </p>

  <pre>
ip addr | grep inet
  </pre>

  <p>
    This should output something similar to this output.
  </p>

  <pre>
inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
inet 192.168.178.98/24 metric 100 brd 192.168.178.255 scope global dynamic enp3s0
inet6 fd00::226a:8aff:fe28:7bce/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute 
inet6 fe80::226a:8aff:fe28:7bce/64 scope link 
  </pre>

  <p>
    My server has a private IP address of
    <code>192.168.178.98</code>. Your will be different
    but will probably also start with something like
    <code>192.168</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are also going to need to know the network interface of our server.
    To achieve this, simply run this command.
  </p>

  <pre>
ip link
  </pre>

  <p>
    Something like the following output should be displayed.
    My network interface is <code>enp3s0</code>, yours will be similar.
    Note that <code>en</code> stands for ethernet here, so if your server
    is using that it should start with the prefix <code>en</code>.
    If you are using wifi (on a laptop for example), then it will start
    with <code>w</code>, in my case I have the interface <code>wlp6s0b1</code>
    which is indeed a wifi port (I am using a laptop as a server).
  </p>

  <pre>
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 20:6a:8a:28:7b:ce brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlp6s0b1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:f4:6a:be:c4:d7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  </pre>

  <p>
    Now we can use our private IP address and turn it into a static one.
    To do this, we will create the file <code>/etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml</code> with the following content.
  </p>

  <pre>
network:
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp3s0:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.178.98/24
      nameservers:
        addresses: [192.168.178.1, 8.8.8.8]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.1.98
  version: 2
  </pre>

  <p>
    Here you obviously need to replace the private IP address with your own.
    Note that <code>8.8.8.8</code> is a public google domain used as a fallback.
    The only thing left to do is run this command we can finally move on.
  </p>

  <pre>
    sudo netplan apply
  </pre>

  <h2>Configuring Samba</h2>

  <p>
    Next we are going to use <a href="https://www.samba.org/">samba</a>
    to handle the actual connection of users to our server storage.
    We start off by installing samba.
  </p>

  <pre>
sudo nala install samba
sudo systemctl status smbd
  </pre>

  <pre>
smbd.service - Samba SMB Daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/smbd.service)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2023-10-22 12:46:40 UTC

...
  </pre>

  <p>
    Running this command should show you that samba is now active.
    I cut out the rest of it as it's not important, but if nala is inactive
    or there were some errors then you should check the rest of the output.
    You may need to reboot your server, nala will have told you if you need.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you made sure samba is running, we are going to configure it.
    Open the file <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code> with the editor of
    your choice (I am gonna use vim which we installed previously).
  </p>

  <pre>
sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
  </pre>

  <p>
    Place the following content at the end of the file.
    Allow me to explain what these terms mean.
  </p>

  <pre>
[first-nas-folder]
   comment = My very first nas folder
   path = "/home/user/folder"
   guest ok = no
   browseable = yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   writable = yes
   read only = no
  </pre>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[first-nas-folder]</strong>: The name of this nas entry</li>
  <li><strong>comment</strong>: My very first NAS folder - Description of the folder</li>
  <li><strong>path</strong>: "/home/user/folder" - The absolute path to the directory on the file system that will be shared.</li>
  <li><strong>guest ok</strong>: no - Specifies whether guest users are allowed to access the shared folder without authentication.</li>
  <li><strong>browseable</strong>: yes - Determines whether the folder is visible and accessible when browsing the shared resources.</li>
  <li><strong>create mask</strong>: 0777 - Sets the default permissions (mask) for newly created files within the shared folder.</li>
  <li><strong>directory mask</strong>: 0777 - Sets the default permissions (mask) for newly created directories within the shared folder.</li>
  <li><strong>writable</strong>: yes - Indicates whether users are allowed to write (modify) files within the shared folder.</li>
  <li><strong>read only</strong>: no - The opposite of 'writable,' indicating that the shared folder is not read-only; users can write to it.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    You can configure as many entries as you want.
    Let's say you would like to create another entry just for movies,
    then you could add the following to you <code>smb.conf</code>.
    Note that the mask <code>0777</code> means that everybody
    access to the server has read and write access.
  </p>

  <pre>
[movies]
   comment = Movies Only Share
   path = /home/user/movies-folder
   guest ok = no
   browseable = yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   writable = yes
   read only = no
  </pre>

  <h2>Settup up Samba Users</h2>

  <p>
    The final step we need to do is to add samba users.
    This will allow users to connect to our server
    using the credentials we will specify now.
    First, create a new user.
  </p>

  <pre>
sudo useradd my-new-user
  </pre>

  <p>
    Then we will add the user to samba.
    It will prompt you to create a password
    for this user. Note that the person you is going to use this
    on their desktop OS will need this password in order to connect
    to the NAS server.
  </p>

  <pre>
sudo smbpasswd -a my-new-user
  </pre>

  <p>
    Finally let's apply our changes to samba by running the following
    two commands.
  </p>

  <pre>
sudo ufw allow samba
sudo systemctl restart smbd
  </pre>

  <p>
    That is it! Your NAS server is all set up now.
    The only thing left to do is to connect to it from your desktop OS.
    I created a separate tutorial for that as this one is already
    quite long, you can
