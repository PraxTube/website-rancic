  <h1>Collision Detection in Bevy using Rapier</h1>
  <time id="blog-date" datetime="2023-11-18">DATE</time>

  <p>
    Pretty much every game needs collisions at some point.
    In this tutorial I will show you how you can implement
    2D collision detections in Bevy using the
    <a href="https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier">Rapier2D crate</a>.
    I will focus on detection and intersections,
    rather then physics based collisions with rigidbodies.
  </p>

  <h2>Intro: What is Rapier, How to Define Colliders</h2>

  <p>
    Given that Bevy doesn't ship with a physics engine
    we will have to choose one for ourselves. The Rapier crate mentioned above
    is a great fit. The description on <a href="https://rapier.rs/docs/">their page</a>
    is as follows
  </p>

  <blockquote cite="https://rapier.rs/docs/">
    <em>
      Rapier is a set of 2D and 3D physics engines written using the
      Rust programming language. It targets applications requiring
      real-time physics like video games, animation, and robotics.
      It is designed to be fast, stable, and optionally cross-platform deterministic.
    </em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Pretty good! It has all the features you would need in a physics game engine.
    I am going to focus on 2D Collision detection here
    (intersions of colliders), as opposed to doing physics
    based collisions with rigidbodies.
  </p>

  <h3>Colliders</h3>

  <p>
    Let's start by understanding how we can define a very simple collider
    in rapier/bevy. Firstly, we use
    <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_rapier2d/latest/bevy_rapier2d/">bevy_rapier2d</a>
    crate which defines bindings to the bevy engine for us.
    Add the following to your app.
  </p>

  <pre>
use bevy_rapier2d::prelude::*;

app.add_plugins((
    RapierPhysicsPlugin::<NoUserData>::default(),
    RapierDebugRenderPlugin::default(),
))
  </pre>

  <p>
    Using this, we can create our first Collider Component.
    You can add it on any entity you like as it is a Component.
  </p>

  <pre>
commands.spawn(
    Collider::cuboid(2.0, 4.0);
)
  </pre>

  <p>
    This will add the <code>Collider</code> component to
    the entity and is all we need in order to specify the collision
    shape. It defines the geometric shape of our entity and allows
    it to interact with the world if attached to a <code>Rigidbody</code>,
    which we will <em>not</em> be doing in this tutorial.
    Check out the <a href="https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/colliders#shapes">the docs</a>
    for a full list of all shapes.
  </p>

  <h2>Collider Intersections in Rapier</h2>

  <p>
    Rapier provides the function
    <a href="https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/scene_queries/#intersection-test"><code>intersections_with_shape</code></a>,
    which we can use to get information about all the shapes a provided collider intersects with.
    Note that this will include <strong>all</strong> colliders,
    meaning also the collider itself.
  </p>

  <pre>
fn test_intersections(rapier_context: Res<RapierContext>) {
    let shape = Collider::cuboid(1.0, 2.0);
    let shape_pos = Vec2::new(0.0, 1.0);
    let shape_rot = 0.8;
    let filter = QueryFilter::default();

    rapier_context.intersections_with_shape(
        &shape_pos, &shape_rot, &shape, filter, |entity| {
        println!("The entity {:?} intersects our shape.", entity);
        // Continue searching intersections with other shapes,
        // false to stop after the first hit
        true 
    });
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    This will print all the entities our shape is colliding with,
    even itself! So if you only have a single collider in your scene
    it would still print something (as it intersects itself).
    To prevent this, we can make use of the <code>QueryFilter</code>.
  </p>

  <pre>
let filter = QueryFilter {
    exclude_collider: Some(entity),
    ..default()
};
  </pre>

  <p>
    Where <code>entity</code> is the <code>Entity</code> that our <code>Collider</code>
    is attached to. This is really all we need to get collision
    detection working in our game. There is however one
    feature you should be aware of before implementing this,
    and that is the <a href="https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/rust/colliders/#collision-groups-and-solver-groups">CollisionGroups</a>.
    These allow us to specify which colliders should intersect
    with which other colliders. This is very similar to
    collision layers/masks of other engines like Unity or Godot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>CollisionGroups</code> takes two <code>u32</code> values,
    the first is the <em>membership</em> and the second the <em>filter</em>.
    You can think of them like this.
  </p>

  <blockquote cite="https://ask.godotengine.org/4010/whats-difference-between-collision-layers-collision-masks">
    <em>
      The membership tells us "I exist on the following layer(s)."
      The filter tells us "I will collide with items that exist on the following layer(s)."
    </em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Each bit that is a <code>1</code> indicates a
    <code>true</code> value, meaning
    it exists on this layer or will collide with this layer.
    By default, all bits are <code>1</code>. To define our own
    <code>CollisionGroups</code> we can use the following code.
  </p>

  <pre>
collision_groups: CollisionGroups::new(
    Group::from_bits(0b1000).unwrap(),
    Group::from_bits(0b0100).unwrap(),
)
  </pre>

  <p>
    Here the collider with the attached <code>collision_groups</code>
    will exist only on the first layer and will only mask (collide)
    with other colliders that live on the second layer.
    You could for example have the first bit represent the player
    and the second bit represent your enemies.
    Then to detech collision of player and enemey you simply have
    to set the collision layer and mask appropriately and you will
    see that they intersect eachother.
  </p>

  <p>
  And that's all there is to know for basic 2D collision detection
  in bevy! If you are still a little confused or would like to
  see this approach implemented in a demo game, check out
