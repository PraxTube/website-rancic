    STILL WIP,
    I created an online multiplayer action game in 6 weeks.
    During this time, I learned a tone about how to make a game
    and get it done. In this blog post I summarize my
    experience of the development of Ace of the Heavens.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Before jumping into the meat of this, I would like to give some
    perspective. I developed this game in 6 weeks, in roughly 200 hours.
    The engine I used is the <a href="https://bevyengine.org">bevy engine</a>,
    written in the Rust programming language.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was certainly not my first attempt at making a video game,
    I started making games more then 5 years ago.
    So it took me 5 years to really publish my first ever game.
    There were many failed attempts and I think there are a lot of
    reasons why I was able to push through with this game and not with
    the ones before. In the following sections, I will do my best
    at explaining what I did and provide you with actionable steps
    you can take to improve you game development journy.
  </p>

  <h2>Define a Deadline</h2>

  <p>
    I believe that one of the reasons I managed to pull through with this project
    was because I had a very clear deadline. I had exactly 150 days to achieve something
    of value in game development for a few reasons that I won't get into here as they don't
    matter, the point is that I <strong>had</strong> to finish the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having a clear deadline and being aware that there is no time to lose kept my momentum
    up and I was focused on developing the features that would be actually useful for the game.
    It also kept me away from wasting my time on <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>.
    This was key in developing an MPV as fast as possible. I also forced me to have a very clear
    vision of the game in mind at all times, which made it possible for me to cut many corners
    and create the architecture of the project for the exact scope I wanted the game to be.
  </p>

  <h2>Have a Clear Vision</h2>

  <p>
    As mentioned earlier, I knew very well what kind of game I was going to create.
    This was crucial, as it allowed me to write code much simpler code
    which most would consider a bad practice because it is rigid and non extendible.
    However it there are two reasons this is a good idea for a beginner:
      <ol>
        <li>You won't need the extensible code anyways if you don't even get out of prototype stage.</li>
        <li>If you know your game's scope, you will be able to cut corners and write simpler systems.</li>
      </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Keeping the scope small is probably the most common advise for new game devs,
    but it's for a good reason. If you plan to create a huge game that you know
    would take years to complete then your code base must be very maintainable.
    If it isn't, you are likely going to lose interest at some point because
    it's just too hard to add new features, features you didn't account for
    when writing the code.
  </p>

  <h2>Always Know Your Next Step</h2>

  <p>
    Everyday, once I finish my work day, I open a file where I store
    all my current tasks and update it (add new ones and delete completed ones).
    Afterwards I think for a moment about my <strong>next</strong> tasks for a
    given project. The next time I am ready to start work I just take a look
    at this file and know exactly what I need to work on.
  </p>

  <pre>
    Ace of the Heavens
      In progress, Added controller support and published v0.2.5!
      Next step is to add controller haptics for more game feel
  </pre>
   
  <p>
    Note that I am not telling you to plan every single little tasks for
    the next 3 years. Your next one or two steps are enough (so the next
    30min - 3h should be planned). I don't believe there is a lot of value
    in over planning or other forms of meta knowledge. In my personal
    experience it usually only resulted in a waste of time. One or two
    steps is all you need (at first).
  </p>

  <h2>Restructure Restructure Restructure</h2>

  <p>
    I cannot tell you how important it is to restructure your game over and over
    if you want to to live for more then just a few weeks. Even if you know exactly
    how your game will look in the end, it's still important to regularly restructure
    your code-base as you learn more and more techniques and general best practices.
    Also keeping files small is very important for me, my motivation to work in a file
    that is larger then 300 lines drops exponentially fast. As game development is an
    inherently stateful process, keeping your files small and concise is very important.
  </p>

  <h2>Use Assets From Others Whenever Possible</h2>

  <p>
    If you are primairly a programmer like me, I highly advise you to not
    create every single art asset on your own. There are so many good
    <a href=https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/>CC0</a>
    licensed assets that you really don't <em>need</em> to make them yourself.
    Of course, if you are an artist then this doesn't really apply to you,
    but even in this case you might want to consider using existing art
    to speed up the process of the development.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Regularly playtest your game to gather feedback.</li>
    <li>Avoid attempting peer-to-peer (P2P) development as a solo endeavor.</li>
    <li>Prioritize adding engaging elements to your game early (juicing it up).</li>
    <li>Don't get bogged down with fixing non-critical bugs or over-architecting (apply the 20/80 rule).</li>
    <li>Avoid excessive frustration and burnout; take regular breaks, especially during challenging times.</li>
    <li>Have the right mindset when developing games</li>
  </ul>
