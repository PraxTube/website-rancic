  <h1>Making a Game in Bevy</h1>
  <p>This is some example text to see how this renders, also can I write < or will that not work >?</p>
  <p>Developing games is a challenging undertaking.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>my setup (mention 150 day challange briefly)</li>
    <li>Allocate 6 weeks full-time (40 hours per week).</li>
    <li>Focus on defining the project scope.</li>
    <li>Regularly playtest your game to gather feedback.</li>
    <li>Avoid attempting peer-to-peer (P2P) development as a solo endeavor.</li>
    <li>Prioritize adding engaging elements to your game early (juicing it up).</li>
    <li>Don't get bogged down with fixing non-critical bugs or over-architecting (apply the 20/80 rule).</li>
    <li>Avoid excessive frustration and burnout; take regular breaks, especially during challenging times.</li>
    <li>Be open to restructuring your project as needed for better results.</li>
    <li>Stay committed to completing your project within the 150-day challenge timeframe.</li>
    <li>Have the right mindset when developing games</li>
  </ul>
