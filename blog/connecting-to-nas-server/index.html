  <h1>Connecting to a NAS server from Windows, Linux and MacOS</h1>
  <time id="blog-date" datetime="2023-11-09">DATE</time>

  <p>
    In this short tutorial I will show you how you can connect to your
    local NAS server that's been configured with Samba
    from all major Desktop OS, Windows, Linux and MacOS.
  </p>

  <h2>Connecting from Windows</h2>

  <p>
    On windows, if you want to connect to a NAS server and have it
    accessable as a native folder, follow
    <a href="https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/Tutorial/store_with_windows?version=6">this tutorial</a>.
    Note that the folder you need to specify has the following structure.
  </p>

  <pre>
\\192.168.178.98\first-nas-folder
  </pre>

  <p>
    If you followed the tutorial on
    <a href="/blog/setting-up-nas-server">how to set up a nas server</a>,
    then you will have noticed that the IP address is the private
    IP address of our NAS server and the directory name is the
    name we specified in the <code>smb.conf</code>.
    All that is left for you to do is to connect with your credentials.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that you must have your network as a <em>private network</em>.
    Otherwise you will not be able to even discover you local NAS server.

  <h2>Connecting from MacOS</h2>

  <p>
    Follow <a href="https://kb.synology.com/en-my/DSM/tutorial/access_nas_from_mac">this</a>
    tutorial to connect to a NAS server from MacOS. Note that you will
    have to write the following as the server address.
  </p>

  <pre>
smb://192.168.178.98/first-nas-folder
  </pre>

  <p>
    If you followed the tutorial on
    <a href="/blog/setting-up-nas-server">how to set up a nas server</a>,
    then you will have noticed that the IP address is the private
    IP address of our NAS server and the directory name is the
    name we specified in the <code>smb.conf</code>.
    All that is left for you to do is to connect with your credentials.
  </p>

  <h2>Connecting from Linux</h2>

  <p>
    Connecting to your NAS server from Linux can be a little bit more tricky.
    If you want to use the a file explorer then it highly depends on the
    desktop environment you are using. It <em>should</em> be similar to
    the Windows file explorer, but again, as there are so many desktop
    environments and even more file explorers it can vary quite heavily.
    I am going to show you an approach using the terminal in the following
    sections. This will work on <strong>every</strong> linux distro,
    regardless of desktop environment. It will even work if you don't
    have any desktop environment at all!
  </p>

  <h3>Creating SSH Short Handle</h3>

  <p>
    In order to make our lives easier, let's create a hostname
    for our NAS private IP address. We do this by adding the following
    line to <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.
  </p>

  <pre>
Host server-name
  HostName 192.168.178.98
  User your-server-user
  </pre>

  <p>
    Replace the <code>HostName</code> with the private IP address of your
    NAS server and <code>User</code> with the username of your NAS server.
    Note that the private IP address here is the one of our NAS server.
    This should look familiar to you if you followed the tutorial on
    <a href="/blog/setting-up-nas-server">how to set up a nas server</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Connecting to NAS server</h3>

  <p>
    Before we actually set up a connection to the NAS server, we first
    need to create a directory where the content of the NAS server should go into.
  </p>

  <pre>
mkdir ~/my-nas-folder
  </pre>

  <p>
    Now we can add the following content to the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file.
  </p>

  <pre>
//server-name/first-nas-folder /home/your-desktop-user/my-nas-folder cifs credentials=/home/your-desktop-user/.samba/your-desktop-user-credentials,uid=your-desktop-user,gid=your-desktop-user0 0
  </pre>

  <ul>
    <li>first-nas-folder: Replace with the name you specified on your NAS folder</li>
    <li>server-name: Replace with the name you specified in <code>~/.ssh/config</code></li>
    <li>your-desktop-user: Replace with you linux user name</li>
    <li>my-nas-folder: Replace with the directory the nas content should go to</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Now test to see if everything went well by running the following.
  </p>

  <pre>
sudo mount -a
  </pre>

  <p>
    If you don't get any error messages,
    then you should see the contents of your NAS server in side of your
    <code>~/my-nas-folder</code>.
    On every mount your machine will automatically
    connect to the NAS server. You should try it by rebooting your machine.
    Once you made sure this works, you are all done!
